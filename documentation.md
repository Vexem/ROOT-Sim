# ROOT-Sim documentation

The continuous integration service of ROOT-Sim automatically rebuilds the internal documentation every time
that a development version or a stable version is released.

We release a stable version seldom, after a significant correctness and performance tests have been carried out.
Therefore, we provide here links to both versions of the documentation, as they can be significantly different.

* [Stable version documentation]({{ site.url }}/docs/master/).
* [Development version documentation]({{ site.url }}/docs/develop/).
